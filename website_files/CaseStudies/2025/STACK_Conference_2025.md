# The 2025 International Meeting of the STACK Community at Durham, UK

Report author: Maciej Matuszewski
Conference Committee: Maciej Matuszewski, Sam Fearn, Clare Wallace, Dan Evans, Stephen Harrap, Fox Radjen

The 2025 International Meeting of the STACK Community took place on April 7-9 at Durham University in the United Kingdom. Durham has been using STACK to great effect since 2019 so it was a wonderful experience to be able to contribute back to the community by hosting this event. The academic programme took place in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, while attendee accommodation was provided in the nearby Grey College.
Continuing the tradition of previous STACK conferences, this was a lively and well attended event – with close to 70 people (including invited speakers) from all over the world attending in person, and about another 30 attending online. The event included over 60 items on its programme, including hour long plenaries, 20 minute talks, 5 minute lightning talks, workshops and network meetings.
Social activities included visits to Durham’s stunning Cathedral (a UNESCO World Heritage site) and a drinks reception in Durham Castle. Pictures from the conference, and conference posters, can be found at [maths.dur.ac.uk/STACK25](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/STACK25).

## Plenary Talks

The conference was headlined two external plenary speakers presenting hour long talks. Professor Meike Akveld of ETH Zürich presented a talk entitled “On-line assessment - an opportunity to rethink our teaching” where she discussed how introducing STACK for assessment has enabled her to fully rework other aspects of teaching. 
Professor Sally Jordan of the Open University (UK) presented a talk entitled “Maximising the benefits: Making our (e)-assessment better”, focusing on careful assessment design, innovative pedagogic uses of e-assessment, and honest evaluation.
Two additional plenary talks were also given. Dr Clare Wallace, assisted by Dr Sam Fearn (both of Durham University) and their final year undergraduate students, presented an hour long internal plenary on the innovative use of STACK as a research topic for final year project students. The talk discussed both the practicalities of learning how to use STACK, but also the theoretical pedagogical background of the benefits and challenges of using automated e-assessment.
Dr Michael Obiero Oyengo and Zachariah Mbasu presented a short online talk on developing a digital textbook for Junior Secondary Schools in Kenya.

## Conference Parallel Talks

The rest of the conference was divided into grouped sessions, mostly presented in two parallel streams with about 50 individual talks and lightning talks. The groups were as follows:
*	Use of Graphics (2 sessions)
These talks discussed how graphics, primarily using JSXGraph, could be used to enhance STACK questions. Topics included discussions of how interactive graphics could be used as an input by students to answer a questions, how graphics could be used to visualise complex mathematical concepts, and how graphics could be used in more applied questions, for example in electrical engineering courses.
*	Expanding Uses of STACK (2 sessions)
These talks discussed how STACK could be used in areas in which it has previously been less used. This included its use in advanced pure maths courses, in particular for assessing proof comprehension and writing, but also how STACK can be localised for languages other than English.
*	Networks, Communities and Repositories (1 session)
These talks discussed the communities that have built around STACK, including reports from previous conferences, and an update on the HELM workbook.
*	Case Studies (4 sessions)
These talks provided updates on the introduction and expansion of use of STACK at institutions around the world. These included a range of different types of higher education courses, but also increasingly the introduction of STACK in secondary education.
*	AI (1 session)
These talks discussed how the STACK community can deal with the rise of generative AI. This included discussions of how to write cheating resistant questions, and how to use AI together with STACK.
*	Analysing student responses (1 session)
These talks discussed how the analytic functions of STACK, including tracing how student answers progressed through the potential response trees, could be used to get further insight into how students use STACK, and their learning process more generally. This included talks on how this information could be utilised.
*	Technical Aspects of STACK (1 session)
These talks discussed technical developments and new features of STACK.
*	Localisation and International Use of STACK
These talks provided further detail on how STACK can be used for non English speaking students.

## Workshops

We hosted a number of workshops and discussion sessions covering various aspects of STACK.
Juma Zevick began the conference with the traditional introductory workshop for new STACK users, where attendees could get the chance to write their very first STACK question. Two subsequent workshops introduced participants to the use of JSXGraph  (Carsten Miller and Alfred Wasserman) and GeoGebra (Guido Pinkernell), with the GeoGebra workshop also particularly focusing on its use in secondary schools. Sam Fearn presented an introductory workshop on how to use Git (with a particular focus on updating STACK documentation) and Andreas Steiger presented a workshop on how to use Zulip to host discussions within the STACK community, with a further discussion on 

## Network Meetings
The now traditional meeting of the STACK Professionals Network, aimed at question authors and lecturers and teaching using STACK in their institutions, was hosted by Konstantina Zerva. George Kinnear also a meeting of the recently formed STACK Researchers Network – which aims to bring together pedagogical researchers looking at how STACK can be used to improve education.
