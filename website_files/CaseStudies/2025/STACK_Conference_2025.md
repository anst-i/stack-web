# The 2025 International Meeting of the STACK Community at Durham, UK

__Report author:__ Maciej Matuszewski

__Conference Committee:__ Maciej Matuszewski, Sam Fearn, Clare Wallace, Dan Evans, Stephen Harrap, Fox Radjen


The 2025 International Meeting of the STACK Community took place on April 7-9 at Durham University in the United Kingdom. Durham has been using STACK to great effect since 2019 so it was a wonderful experience to be able to contribute back to the community by hosting this event. The academic programme took place in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, while attendee accommodation was provided in the nearby Grey College.

Continuing the tradition of previous STACK conferences, this was a lively and well attended event – with over 90 people (including invited speakers) from all over the world attending in person, and about another 30 attending online. An introduction was provided by Professor Simon Gardiner, Deputy Executive Dean (Education) in the Faculty of Science at Durham University, who stressed the importance of innovation in higher eudcation.  The event included over 60 items on its programme, including hour long plenaries, 20 minute talks, 5 minute lightning talks, workshops and network meetings.
Social activities included visits to Durham’s stunning Cathedral (a UNESCO World Heritage site) and a drinks reception in Durham Castle. Pictures from the conference, and conference posters, can be found at [maths.dur.ac.uk/STACK25](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/STACK25).

## Plenary Talks

The conference was headlined two external plenary speakers presenting hour long talks. 

Professor Meike Akveld of ETH Zürich presented a talk entitled “On-line assessment - an opportunity to rethink our teaching” where she discussed how replacing elements of traditional lectures with STACK  questions has enabled an improvement and transformation of teaching methodology, optimising student engagement.

Professor Sally Jordan of the Open University (UK) presented a talk entitled “Maximising the benefits: Making our (e)-assessment better”, focusing on careful assessment design, innovative pedagogic uses of e-assessment, and honest evaluation. The talk provided an optimistic outlook on how new technological developments can improve the student experience as long as they are introduced carefully.


Two additional plenary talks were also given. 

Dr Clare Wallace, assisted by Dr Sam Fearn (both of Durham University) and their final year undergraduate students, presented an hour long internal plenary on the innovative use of STACK as a research topic for final year project students. The talk discussed both the practicalities of learning how to use STACK, but also the theoretical pedagogical background of the benefits and challenges of using automated e-assessment.

Dr Michael Obiero Oyengo and Zachariah Mbasu presented a short online talk on developing a digital textbook for Junior Secondary Schools in Kenya to adress issues with currently inadequate and inaccurate teaching materials. The talk introduced innovative ways of integrating STACK into PreTeXt.

## Conference Parallel Talks

The rest of the conference was divided into grouped sessions, mostly presented in two parallel streams with about 50 individual talks and lightning talks. The groups were as follows:
*	__Use of Graphics (2 sessions)__
These talks discussed how graphics, primarily using JSXGraph, could be used to enhance STACK questions. Topics included discussions of how interactive graphics could be used as an input by students to answer a questions, how graphics could be used to visualise complex mathematical concepts, and how graphics could be used in more applied questions, for example in electrical engineering courses.
*	__Expanding Uses of STACK (2 sessions)__
These talks discussed how STACK could be used in areas in which it has previously been less used. This included its use in advanced pure maths courses, in particular for assessing proof comprehension and writing, but also how STACK can be localised for languages other than English.
*	__Networks, Communities and Repositories (1 session)__
These talks discussed the communities that have built around STACK, including reports from previous conferences, and an update on the HELM workbook.
*	__Case Studies (4 sessions)__
These talks provided updates on the introduction and expansion of use of STACK at institutions around the world. These included a range of different types of higher education courses, but also increasingly the introduction of STACK in secondary education.
*	__AI (1 session)__
These talks discussed how the STACK community can deal with the rise of generative AI. This included discussions of how to write cheating resistant questions, and how to use AI together with STACK.
*	__Analysing student responses (1 session)__
These talks discussed how the analytic functions of STACK, including tracing how student answers progressed through the potential response trees, could be used to get further insight into how students use STACK, and their learning process more generally. This included talks on how this information could be utilised.
*	__Technical Aspects of STACK (1 session)__
These talks discussed technical developments and new features of STACK.
*	__Localisation and International Use of STACK (1 session)__
These talks provided further detail on how STACK can be used for non English speaking students.

Conference proceedings are currently being edited. Videos of recorded sessions have been distributed to participants. Some speakers have given permission for videos of their talks to be made public. These are currently being edited.

## Workshops

We hosted a number of workshops and discussion sessions covering various aspects of STACK.

Juma Zevick began the conference with the traditional introductory workshop for new STACK users, where attendees could get the chance to write their very first STACK question. Two subsequent workshops introduced participants to the use of JSXGraph  (Carsten Miller and Alfred Wasserman) and GeoGebra (Guido Pinkernell), with the GeoGebra workshop also particularly focusing on its use in secondary schools. Sam Fearn presented an introductory workshop on how to use Git (with a particular focus on updating STACK documentation) and Andreas Steiger presented a workshop on how to use Zulip to host discussions within the STACK community, with a further discussion on how the experience of using the Zulip STACK community can be improved, and how to encourage more people to join.

## Network Meetings
The now traditional meeting of the STACK Professionals Network, aimed at question authors and lecturers and teaching using STACK in their institutions, was hosted by Konstantina Zerva. Notes from this meeting can be found [here](https://stack-assessment.org/MeetingReports/2025-04-09-ProfessionalsNetwork/). Individuals interested in joining this network can find more infomration [here](https://stack-assessment.org/Communities/Professional_network/).

George Kinnear also a meeting of the recently formed STACK Researchers Network – which aims to bring together pedagogical researchers looking at how STACK can be used to improve education. Various potential areas of research were discussed, including the possiblity of international collaboration on research into how students use STACK feedback. Individuals interested in joining this network can find more information [here](https://stack-assessment.org/Communities/Researchers_network/).

## Conclusions

The conference made it clear that interest in STACK is continuing to grow, with more institutions introducing it in a wider range of contexts. New features being added to STACK continue to make it a more attractive offering, with members of the STACK community continuing to use it in innovative ways, including very impressive analysis and visualisation of how students answer questions, which can be used to further understand how we can improve our pedagogical offering. Support is continuing to be developed for people using STACK for research, as well as for educators who are joining the community from areas other than Mathematics Departments at Universities.
