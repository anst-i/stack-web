# Meclib: supporting mechanical systems

Martin Kraska

### Introduction

Meclib is a set of tools to simplify authoring of STACK questions with a focus on 
- JSXGraph based static and interactive illustrations controlled by Maxima lists (defined in the question variables)
- Maxima functions for rich formative feedback on interactive graphic input and on numeric or symbolic expressions.

The set of objects is created with sketches of mechanical systems in mind (support and load symbols, bars, ropes, disks, annotations). The most advanced application is the interactive creation of free body diagrams with rich formative feedback.

The primary website of the project is on Github. A good entry point is the [Wiki](https://github.com/mkraska/meclib/wiki).

There is a demo Moodle site, where Meclib examples can be tested. It is hosted at Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences (Technische Hochschule Brandenburg, THB).

[External Moodle Course](https://extmoodle.th-brandenburg.de/course/view.php?id=138)

- You can create an account on the server or use the guest login
- You need an account to actually access the demo questions, the other contents (slides, papers) can be accessed with guest login.
- No course password required.



### Getting started

The author of Meclib has developed two introductory workshop formats. They are documented in the Meclib wiki. With basic experience in authoring STACK questions, these workshops can be worked through without assistance. Guided workshops can be booked (kraska@th-brandenburg.de). 
- [My first Meclib question](https://github.com/mkraska/meclib/wiki/My-first-Meclib-question) Tutorial for a simple question with interactive input (center of gravity of a triangle). This workshop takes approximately 1.5 hrs if the basics of STACK questions are known.

- [FBD Example Question](https://github.com/mkraska/meclib/wiki/FBD-Example-Question) Tutorial for a STACK question with interactive free body diagram editor, input of equillibrium conditions and support reactions. This workshop takes 6 hrs in total. For guided workshops, a distribution over two days is recommended in order to provide intermediate space for individual tryout by the participants.

### Maxima driven JSXGraph graphics

The basic idea behind meclib is that question authors can embed high quality, visually consistent sketches with or without interactive elements into their STACK questions without writing a single line of Javascript. All contents of the graphics is driven by a Maxima list of object description lists inside the question variables. This list is injected into a generic part of the question text, which contains a `[[JSXGraph ]]` block. In early stages of Meclib development, this generic block contained the full JavaScript code (more than 2000 lines). Currently, the embedding using `[[include ]]` is recommended.

The available objects are documented in the [Meclib wiki](https://github.com/mkraska/meclib/wiki/List-of-Objects).

This is how the generic Meclib block for a static (non-interactive) image in the question text looks like (usually it is copy-pasted from the Meclib wiki)

```
[[lang code="de"]] [[/lang]][[lang code="other"]] [[/lang]]
<div style="float:right">
[[jsxgraph width='250px' height='250px' ]] 
var mode  = "STACK";  // as opposed to "jsfiddle" which is used in the test environment
var stateRef;         // is empty in the non-interactive case
const initstring = {#init#}; // injection of the list of objects
var decsep = {#stackfltsep#};  // injection of the decimal separator setting
const centeredLabelStyle = {size:0, showInfobox:false, label:{offset:[-6,0], 
  anchorX:'left', anchorY:'middle'}};
// End of STACK header
[[include src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkraska/meclib/main/meclib.js" /]]
[[/jsxgraph]]</div>
```

Setting up such graphics is quite easy, getting started takes just a couple of hours and can be mastered by student assistants, including randomization.

For interactive graphical input, the `[[jsxgraph ]]` block is bound to two hidden input fields. `objects` is a string input filed, which stores a JSON version of the graphics specification. If the user modifies a graphic, these changes are reflected in this input field. Beyond the modification of existing objects, this includes dynamically generated or deleted objects, as required for interactive edit of free body diagrams.

For such questions, the basic effort is not in setting up the graphics side but in consistent and comprehensive feedback. 

### Editor for free body diagrams

Right from the start, Meclib was developed with the automatic assessment of free body diagrams (FBD) in mind. These are idealized drawings of mechanical systems, where the system is isolated by removing the environmental components and replac-ing their action by forces and moments (constraint reactions). Only after this step, equilibrium conditions can be established, which then are solved for the unknown reactions. Therefore, drawing correct FBDs is an important skill in engineering mechanics.

Based on observations of typical mistakes in written exams and classroom exercises, the following requirements and design decisions for an FBD training and assessment tool have been established by the author:
-	The system schematic should preferably be built of standard elements (objects).
-	System isolation is visualized by graying out elements of the environment (connectors, supports), thus no new sketch is made but the FBD is created in place.
- The user can create, delete and label force and moment symbols.
- The attribution of user-generated objects to individual system elements is done via automatic proximity checks on JSXGraph side.
- Intelligent snap mechanisms enable precise positioning and orientation of reactions, even if that might give unwanted hints.
- There should be rich formative feedback for the individual decisions made while creating an FBD.
- Based on the force and moment symbols introduced by the user, the reference solutions for equilibrium conditions are auto-generated and used for feedback on student solution. This is why labelling and precise positioning are required.

In particular, the last requirement initially seemed non-trivial, because the standard interface between STACK and JSXGraph doesnâ€™t allow for extraction of symbolic expressions from text input fields. Thus, an additional algebraic input field needs to be bound to the JSXGraph board.

The following images show an idealized initial system and the completed FBD along with their respective representation on Maxima side. The elements `forceGen` and `momentGen` at the top of the canvas are generators for force and moment symbols. In the text fields, the label can be entered. The object is created by dragging the gray symbols away from their position. Elements of the system can be deactivated by double-clicking. 

The next image shows the initial system schematic and Maxima list of object specifications. The task is to replace the sup-ports by appropriate reactions and the distributed load by a resultant force. Whenever the button Check is pressed, feedback is generated

### Feedback functions

### Localization

Meclib is fit for multilingual feedback and configurable decimal separator. Multilingual feedback uses the STACK language block `[[lang ]]`.
