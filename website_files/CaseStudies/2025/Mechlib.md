# Meclib: supporting mechanical systems

Martin Kraska

### Introduction

Meclib is a set of tools to simplify authoring of STACK questions with a focus on 
- JSXGraph based static and interactive illustrations controlled by Maxima lists (defined in the question variables)
- Maxima functions for rich formative feedback on interactive graphic input and on numeric or symbolic expressions.

The set of objects is created with sketches of mechanical systems in mind (support and load symbols, bars, ropes, disks, annotations). The most advanced application is the interactive creation of free body diagrams with rich formative feedback.

Documentation: see [Wiki](https://github.com/mkraska/meclib/wiki).
