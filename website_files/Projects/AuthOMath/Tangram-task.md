# Tangram tasks for pre-service teachers

### José Manuel Diego Mantecón, Universidad de Cantabria, Spain 

The AuthoMath Project allows us to use GeoGebra applets on STACK. This offers 
a wide range of tasks that we can create and provide feedback to. Students 
have the chance to work in an interactive environment and use different 
tecniques to solve the same task.

There are many ways to compute the area and the perimeter of a figure. In 
this task, we go through a few of them using Tangram pieces that our 
pre-service teachers can move around and rotate. They can use this applet to 
make the calculations using different units of measurement.

In this task we ask them to compute and compare the area and the perimeter of 
two figures, but also to reflect on what they are doing as a way to teach 
these concepts to primary school students. Mathematical concepts go hand in 
hand with didactical notions.
