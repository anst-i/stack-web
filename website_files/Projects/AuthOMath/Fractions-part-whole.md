# Fractions as Part of One Whole 

### Gunter Ehret, Heidelberg University of Education, Germany

STACK offers the possibility to give adaptive feedback. STACK tasks could therefore be an enrichment for maths lessons and a relief for teachers, especially in schools where self-directed learning plays an important role.

This example task was created by teacher-education students in a didactics seminar at the Heidelberg University of Education.  In this task children test their understanding fractions as part of one whole.  Different types of feedback can be shown, depending on the input of the students.

If the sliders are set so that the dynamic illustration correctly represents the required fraction, there is a detailed confirmation of correctness in mathematically correct language, as well as a request to repeat the task five times in a row, with the required fraction changing each time.

If the input is incorrect, this is fed back and the student can either repeat the task directly or wait 15 seconds for the sample solution.

The programme also identifies if an equivalent fraction is entered; the feedback can be different here, in the case presented in the video it refers to a learner who has not yet formally learned to expand and reduce fractions.
