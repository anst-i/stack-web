# AuthOMath multiplier event: using GeoGebra in STACK

The Erasmus Project AuthOMath <https://www.authomath.org/> has enabled us to integrate STACK with GeoGebra.  In particular, we can now include GeoGebra worksheets as an input enabling students to give an answer which is a geometric diagram.  Mathematical and physical phenomena can be better understood and explored via visualization.  This is a practical workshop for users interested in getting started with this new feature.

Examples of materials developed by the AuthOMath project are given in the [AuthOMath project page](../Projects/AuthOMath/index.md).

Documentation for this new feature is available [in the STACK documentation](https://docs.stack-assessment.org/en/Topics/GeoGebra/)

**When:** Wednesday 27th March 2024.

**Where:** The University of Edinburgh, James Clerk Maxwell building, Room 5323 (for in-person attendees) and online.  Times below are GMT.
