# INTERNATIONAL ONLINE CONFERENCE “LEARNING MATHEMATICS : DIGITAL AND INTERACTIVE” ON 3 FEBRUARY 2024

The Erasmus Project AuthOMath <https://www.authomath.org/> has achieved its objectives!

On 3 February 2024, the project will present its results:

* The technical integration of GeoGebra applets into the digital assessment system STACK
* A didactic concept for the design of digital maths tasks with interactive elements in task and feedback.

The presentation will be part of a one-day online conference with speakers

* Chris Sangwin (Edinburgh)
* Susanne Narciss (Dresden)
* Andreas Eichler (Kassel)
* Susanne Dingel (Landau)

In addition, Tim Lutz (Landau) and Patrick Galm (Heidelberg) will offer workshops on technical and didactic aspects of the combination of GeoGebra and STACK.
